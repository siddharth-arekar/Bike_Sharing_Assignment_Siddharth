README: Modelling Bike Demand for Shared Bike System
Business Goal
The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various independent variables. This model will:
•	Help management understand how demand varies with different features.
•	Allow manipulation of business strategies to meet demand levels and improve customer satisfaction.
•	Serve as a tool for management to analyze demand dynamics in new markets.

Data Preparation
Data Overview
The dataset contains independent variables (predictors) and the target variable (cnt) which represents the total demand for bikes. Notable variables include:
•	season and weathersit: Numerical values that need to be converted to categorical string values.
•	yr: Indicates years 2018 (0) and 2019 (1).
•	casual, registered, and cnt: The cnt variable will be the target, while casual and registered will not be used as predictors to avoid data leakage.
Preprocessing Steps
1.	Converting Variables to Categorical: Variables such as season and weathersit have numerical values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4) that represent categories. These should be converted to categorical strings using the data dictionary to avoid misleading the model with numerical relationships.
2.	Retaining yr: Despite having only two values (0 and 1), the yr column is retained because it captures a temporal trend of increasing demand over years, which is valuable for prediction.
3.	Feature Engineering: All relevant independent variables will be included, while columns such as instant (row identifier) or variables highly correlated with others may be dropped to reduce multicollinearity.
4.	Handling Missing or Outlier Values: Any missing values or outliers will be addressed using appropriate imputation or transformation techniques.

Model Building
Target Variable
•	cnt: Total demand for bikes, which is the sum of casual and registered users.
Independent Variables
Key predictors include:
•	Temporal variables: yr, season, mnth, weekday, workingday.
•	Weather variables: temp, atemp, hum, windspeed, weathersit.
•	Categorical variables like season and weathersit will be one-hot encoded.
Regression Model
A linear regression model will be built to predict the cnt variable:
1.	Split the data into training and test sets.
2.	Fit the model using the training set.
3.	Evaluate the model on the test set.

Model Evaluation
R-squared Metric
Use the following code to calculate the R-squared score on the test set:
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
r2_score(y_test, y_pred)
Here:
•	y_test: Actual values of the target variable in the test set.
•	y_pred: Predicted values of the target variable in the test set.
The R-squared score on the test set indicates how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Residual Analysis
Residual plots will be analyzed to check assumptions of linear regression, such as:
•	Homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors).
•	Normality of residuals.
________________________________________
Key Considerations
1.	Multicollinearity: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) will be calculated to detect and address multicollinearity among predictors.
2.	Normalization/Standardization: Features like temp, hum, and windspeed may be scaled if necessary for model performance.
3.	Feature Selection: Irrelevant or redundant features will be removed to improve the model's efficiency and interpretability.

Summary
This project involves preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation. The resulting model will provide actionable insights into the factors driving bike demand, enabling management to optimize their strategies and better meet customer needs.
